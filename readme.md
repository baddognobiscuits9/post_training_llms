# Post-Training of Large Language Models

## Overview

This repository demonstrates three post-training techniques for LLMs:
- **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)**
- **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** 
- **Online RL (Online Reinforcement Learning)**

## Source

Code based on: **[DeepLearning.AI Course - Post-Training of LLMs](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/post-training-of-llms)**

*Implemented locally on laptop for demonstration purposes.*
